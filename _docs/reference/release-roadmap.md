## 2017 Q4 / 2018 Q1 Plans

- JFrogâ€™s Xray implementation of Grafeas API
- A Google artifact metadata API implementation of Grafeas, together with Google Container Registry vulnerability scanning
- Bi-directional metadata sync between JFrog Xray and the Google artifact metadata API
- Black Duck integration with Grafeas and the Google artifact metadata API

## Beyond

- Google Container Engine BinAuth: providing deploy-time signature verification of metadata in artifact metadata API so only explicitly authorized code is deployed to production
- More component type support
- More bi-directional metadata sync integrations
- More client libraries (and make them available in distributions like Maven Central, PIP, etc.)
- More secret and access management use cases

Please get in touch if there are features you'd like to see in our future releases!
